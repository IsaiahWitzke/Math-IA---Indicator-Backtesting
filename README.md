# Grade 12 Math IA: Indicator-Backtesting
This is a project I completed for my grade 12 IB math course in which I backtested some popular technical finacial indicators on popular ETFs.

I originally did the analysis in Google Sheets (which became very inefficient, very quickly)! If you would like to see the original Google Sheets document I used, you can view it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IAKk8RMskf_2NkFfJGiY-CjIx1lCoHc_M3pKdqjjRvc/edit?usp=sharing). Otherwise, you can download the Excel file or pdf version of the spreadsheet from this repository.

The write-up for this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10I08UIaOPWO7a7r-l56bVek1T04USuECxVUUfEiAdEQ/edit?usp=sharing), or can be downloaded from this repository in pdf form.
